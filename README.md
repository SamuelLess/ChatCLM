## Overview
Welcome to _chatCLM_, a Rust-based project utilizing the [leptos](https://leptos.dev) framework to build a compression-based Large Language Model (LLM) using zstd and the OpenAI tokenizer.
This project aims to create an efficient, high-performance LLM by leveraging the power of compression algorithms.
